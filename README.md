EchoFusionCare develops cutting-edge ultrasound imaging technologies to enhance patient care and support clinical decision-making.

We combine freehand ultrasound acquisition, real-time 3D reconstruction, and artificial intelligence to extract clinically meaningful information from standard 2D ultrasound data.

Our unique data fusion approach enables:

   • Volumetric 3D reconstruction from freehand 2D ultrasound scans
  
   • Super-resolution imaging and enhanced internal structure analysis 
  
   • AI-powered diagnostic support, for faster, more accurate and accessible medical assessments
  

At EchoFusionCare, we bring advanced technology into the hands of healthcare professionals — making high-quality diagnostics more reliable, efficient, and available, even in resource-limited settings.
